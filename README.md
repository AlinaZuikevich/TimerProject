**Project Description**

>This timer counts down the time specified by the user. Pressing the "Clear" button allows you to clear the time value selection field for re-establishing it. Pressing the "Start" button refreshes the widget window and starts the timer. Next, the "Stop" and "Play" buttons appear, which stop and continue the countdown, respectively. When you click on the "Cancel Timer" button, the timer stops and a pop-up message appears stating that the timer has been canceled, after which the window closes. When the timer expires, a pop-up message appears stating that the time has expired.

## Required libraries:

- [future](https://pypi.org/project/future/) -  is the missing compatibility layer between Python 2 and Python 3. It allows you to use a single, clean Python 3.x-compatible codebase to support both Python 2 and Python 3 with minimal overhead (needed to use the Tkinter library).
- [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) - is the Python Imaging Library by Fredrik Lundh and Contributors. The Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter. This library provides extensive file format support, an efficient internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing capabilities.

## Installation:
```sh
pip install future
